# 100DaysOfCode

100 Days of Code Challenge is an initiative I am commiting to take, where I will be spending each day working on problem solving and personal projects to improve my skills and push my boundaries.

I'm going to follow Two Main Rules:

Code a minimum of an hour every day for the next 100 days.

Complete as many courses, classes, challenges 

My Exception:

If I break the streak, I will make sure that I won't break it the next day
